# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) using TROCR

This repository contains code for Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) tasks, primarily focusing on using Tr-OCR (Transformer-based Optical Character Recognition) for optical character recognition.

## Introduction

ANPR is a technology that uses optical character recognition on images to read vehicle registration plates. This repository provides a solution for ANPR tasks, leveraging Tr-OCR.

## Features

- **Tr-OCR Integration**: Utilizes Tr-OCR for robust optical character recognition.
- **ANPR Functionality**: Provides functionality for extracting and recognizing vehicle registration plates from images.
- **Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune Tr-OCR on our own Malaysian Carplate dataset for improved performance.
- **Easy-to-Use**: Simple and straightforward implementation for ANPR tasks.

## Installation
